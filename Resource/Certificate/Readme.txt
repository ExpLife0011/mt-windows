This directory, by default, contains a self-signed certificate not protected by any type of password.  If you would like to use a real software signing certificate (as is required for driver distribution) simply replace the test-signing certificate shown here with the code signing certificate of your choosing.  The Microsoft Verisign Class 3 cross-signing certificate is already provided here.

Be sure that the appropriate cross signing certificate is also available to the catalog file generator, or you will not be able to install drivers.

Finally, if your code signing certificate is protected by a password, be sure to set the "CertPass" environment macro to this password in the Visual Studio property sheet, reachable here:

View->Property Manager
Find "CryptoSettings"
Right-click, Properties
User Macros
Double-click "CertPass"
Change password as required

All of the certificates in this directory can be regenerated by running "MakeTestCert.bat" in a Visual Studio command prompt.
